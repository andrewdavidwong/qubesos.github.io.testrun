  title: Why Qubes OS ?
  subsections:
    - section: 1
      title: Physical isolation is a given safeguard that the digital world lacks 
      paragraphs:
        - paragraph: "Throughout their lives, individuals engage in various activities such as going to school, working, voting, taking care of their families or visiting with friends. These activities are spatially and temporally bound : they happen in isolation of one another, in their own compartments, which often represent an essential safeguard, such as in the case of voting."
        - paragraph: "In our digital lives, the situation is quite different: All of our activities typically happen on a single device. This causes us to worry about whether it's safe to click on a link or install an app, since being hacked imperils our entire digital existence."
        - paragraph: Qubes eliminates this concern by allowing us to divide a device into many compartments, much as we divide a physical building into many rooms. Better yet, it allows us to create new compartments whenever we need them, and it gives us sophisticated tools for securely managing our activities and data across these compartments.
    - section: 2
      title: Qubes allows you to compartmentalize your digital life
      paragraphs:
        - paragraph: Many of us are initially surprised to learn that our devices do not support the kind of secure compartmentalization that our lives demand, and we're disappointed that software vendors rely on generic defenses that repeatedly succumb to new attacks.
        - paragraph: "In building Qubes, our working assumption is that all software contains bugs. Not only that, but in their stampeding rush to meet deadlines, the world's stressed-out software developers are pumping out new code at a staggering rate &mdash; far faster than the comparatively smaller population of security experts could ever hope to analyze it for vulnerabilities, much less fix everything. Rather than pretend that we can prevent these inevitable vulnerabilities from being exploited, we've designed Qubes under the assumption that they <em>will</em> be exploited. It's only a matter of time until the next zero-day attack."
        - paragraph:
          - snippets:
            - snippet: "In light of this sobering reality, Qubes takes an eminently practical approach: confine, control, and contain the damage. It allows you to keep valuable data separate from risky activities, preventing cross-contamination. This means you you can do everything on the same physical computer without having to worry about a single successful cyberattack taking down your entire digital life in one fell swoop. In fact, Qubes has"
            - snippet: distinct advantages over physical air gaps.

    - section: 3
      title: Made to support vulnerable users and power users alike
      paragraphs:
        - paragraph: "Qubes provides practical, usable security to vulnerable and actively-targeted individuals, such as journalists, activists, whistleblowers, and researchers. Qubes is designed with the understanding that people make mistakes, and it allows you to protect yourself from your own mistakes. It's a place where you can click on links, open attachments, plug in devices, and install software free from worry. It's a place where <em>you</em> have control over your software, not the other way around."

        - paragraph: "Qubes is one of the few operating systems that places the security of its users above all else. It is, and always will be, free and open-source software, because the fundamental operating system that constitutes the core infrastructure of our digital lives <em>must</em> be free and open-source in order to be trustworthy."
