      title: Physical isolation is a given safeguard that the digital world lacks 
      paragraphs:
        - paragraph: Throughout their lives, individuals engage in various activities such as going to school, working, voting, taking care of their families or visiting with friends.  
        - paragraph: "These activities are spatially and temporally bound : they happen in isolation of one another, in their own compartments, which often represent an essential safeguard, such as in the case of voting."
        - paragraph: "In one's digital life, the situation is quite different : each activity, often intertwined with its real-life counterpart, tends to happen on a single computing device."
